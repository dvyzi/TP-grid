                    <p>If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?</p>

                    <p>Libertians want to live  in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatics weapons. A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.</p>
